What's the Matter,\nThat Oaks must come from Thrace to dance?\nMust stupid Stocks be taught to flatter?\nAnd is there no such Wood in France?\nWhy must the Winds all hold their Tongue?\nIf they a little Breath should raise;\nWould that have spoil'd the Poet's Song;\nOr puff'd away the Monarch's Praise?\nII\nPindar, that Eagle, mounts the Skies;\nWhile Virtue leads the noble Way:\nToo like a Vultur Boileau flies,\nWhere sordid Interest shows the Prey.\nWhen once the Poet's Honour ceases,\nFrom Reason far his Transports rove:\nAnd Boileau, for eight hundred Pieces,\nMakes Louis take the Wall of Jove.\nIII\nNeptune and Sol came from above,\nShap'd like Megrigny and Vauban:\nThey arm'd these Rocks; then show'd old Jove\nOf Marli Wood, the Wond'rous Plan.\nSuch Walls, these three wise Gods agreed,\nBy Human Force could ne'er be shaken:\nBut You and I in Homer read\nOf Gods, as well as Men, mistaken.\nSambre and Maese their Waves may join;\nBut ne'er can William's Force restrain:\nHe'll pass them Both, who pass'd the Boyn:\nRemember this, and arm the Sein.\nIV\nFull fifteen thousand lusty Fellows\nWith Fire and Sword the Fort maintain:\nEach was a Hercules, You tell us;\nYet out they march'd like common Men.\nCannons above, and Mines below\nDid Death and Tombs for Foes contrive:\nYet Matters have been order'd so,\nThat most of Us are still alive.\nV\nIf Namur be compar'd to Troy;\nThen Britain's Boys excell'd the Greeks:\nTheir Siege did ten long Years employ:\nWe've done our Bus'ness in ten Weeks.\nWhat Godhead does so fast advance,\nWith dreadful Pow'r those Hills to gain?\n'Tis little Will, the Scourge of France;\nNo Godhead, but the first of Men.\nHis mortal Arm exerts the Pow'r,\nTo keep ev'n Mons's Victor under:\nAnd that same Jupiter no more\nShall fright the World with impious Thunder.\nVI\nOur King thus trembles at Namur,\nWhilst Villeroy, who ne'er afraid is,\nTo Bruxelles marches on secure,\nTo bomb the Monks, and scare the Ladies.\nAfter this glorious Expedition,\nOne Battle makes the Marshal Great:\nHe must perform the King's Commission:\nWho knows, but Orange may retreat?\nKings are allow'd to feign the Gout,\nOr be prevail'd with not to Fight:\nAnd mighty Louis hop'd, no doubt,\nThat William wou'd preserve that Right.\nVII\nFrom Seyn and Loyre, to Rhone and Po,\nSee every Mother's Son appear:\nIn such a Case ne'er blame a Foe,\nIf he betrays some little Fear.\nHe comes, the mighty Vill'roy comes;\nFinds a small River in his Way:\nSo waves his Colours, beats his Drums;\nAnd thinks it prudent there to stay.\nThe Gallic Troops breath Blood and War:\nThe Marshal cares not to march faster:\nPoor Vill'roy moves so slowly here,\nWe fancy'd all, it was his Master.\nVIII\nWill no kind Flood, no friendly Rain\nDisguise the Marshal's plain Disgrace?\nNo Torrents swell the low Mehayne?\nThe World will say, he durst not pass.\nWhy will no Hyades appear,\nDear Poet, on the Banks of Sambre?\nJust as they did that mighty Year,\nWhen You turn'd June into December.\nThe Water-Nymphs are too unkind\nTo Vill'roy; are the Land-Nymphs so?\nAnd fly They All, at Once Combin'd\nTo shame a General, and a Beau?\nIX\nTruth, Justice, Sense, Religion, Fame\nMay join to finish William's Story:\nNations set free may bless his Name;\nAnd France in Secret own his Glory.\nBut Ipres, Mastrich, and Cambray,\nBesancon, Ghent, St. Omers, Lysle,\nCourtray, and Dole Ye Criticks, say,\nHow poor to this was Pindar's Style?\nWith Eke's and Also's tack thy Strain,\nGreat Bard; and sing the deathless Prince,\nWho lost Namur the same Campaign,\nHe bought Dixmude, and plunder'd Deynse.\nX\nI'll hold Ten Pound, my Dream is out:\nI'd tell it You, but for the Rattle\nOf those confounded Drums: no doubt\nYon' bloody Rogues intend a Battel.\nDear me! a hundred thousand French\nWith Terror fill the neighb'ring Field;\nWhile William carries on the Trench,\n'Till both the Town and Castle yield.\nVill'roy to Boufflers should advance,\nSays Mars, thro' Cannons Mouths in Fire;\nId est , one Mareschal of France\nTells t'other, He can come no nigher.\nXI\nRegain the Lines the shortest Way,\nVill'roy; or to Versailles take Post:\nFor, having seen it, Thou can'st say\nThe Steps, by which Namur was lost.\nThe Smoke and Flame may vex thy Sight:\nLook not once back: but as thou goest,\nQuicken the Squadrons in their Flight;\nAnd bid the D l take the slowest.\nThink not what Reason to produce,\nFrom Louis to conceal thy Fear:\nHe'll own the Strength of thy Excuse;\nTell him that William was but there.\nXII\nNow let us look for Louis' Feather,\nThat us'd to shine so like a Star:\nThe Gen'rals could not get together,\nWanting that Influence, great in War.\nO Poet! Thou had'st been discreeter,\nHanging the Monarch's Hat so high;\nIf Thou had'st dubb'd thy Star, a Meteor,\nThat did but blaze, and rove, and die.\nXIII\nTo animate the doubtful Fight,\nNamur in vain expects that Ray:\nIn vain France hopes, the sickly Light\nShou'd shine near William's fuller Day.\nIt knows Versailles, it's proper Station;\nNor cares for any foreign Sphere:\nWhere You see Boileau's Constellation,\nBe sure no Danger can be near.\nXIV\nThe French had gather'd all their Force;\nAnd William met them in their Way:\nYet off they brush'd, both Foot and Horse.\nWhat has Friend Boileau left to say?\nWhen his high Muse is bent upon't,\nTo sing her King, that Great Commander,\nOr on the Shores of Hellespont,\nOr in the Valleys near Scamander;\nWou'd it not spoil his noble Task,\nIf any foolish Phrygian there is,\nImpertinent enough to ask,\nHow far Namur may be from Paris?\nXV\nTwo Stanza's more before we end,\nOf Death, Pikes, Rocks, Arms, Bricks, and Fire:\nLeave 'em behind You, honest Friend:\nAnd with your Country-Men retire.\nYour Ode is spoilt; Namur is freed;\nFor Dixmuyd something yet is due:\nSo good Count Guiscard may proceed;\nBut Boufflers, Sir, one Word with you. \nXVI\n'Tis done. In Sight of these Commanders,\nWho neither Fight, nor raise the Siege,\nThe Foes of France march safe thro' Flanders;\nDivide to Bruxelles, or to Liege.\nSend, Fame, this News to Trianon;\nThat Boufflers may new Honours gain:\nHe the same Play by Land has shown,\nAs Tourville did upon the Main.\nYet is the Marshal made a Peer:\nO William, may thy Arms advance;\nThat He may lose Dinant next Year,\nAnd so be Constable of France."

E-ye-he-kt'!\nH'-kta-c'; '-ye-ce-qu'n.\nM'-Wamdee-sk', he-he-kt',\nHe-kta-c', '-ye-ce-qu'n,\nM'-Wamdee-sk'.\"\nTRANSLATON\nHe will come; he will come;\nHe will come, for he promised.\nMy White Eagle, he will come;\nHe will come, for he promised \nMy White Eagle.\nThus sadly she chanted, and lo \nallured by her sorrowful accents \nFrom the dark covert crept a red roe\nand wonderingly gazed on Winona.\nThen swift caught the huntress her bow;\nfrom her trembling hand hummed the keen arrow.\nUp-leaped the red roebuck and fled,\nbut the white snow was sprinkled with scarlet,\nAnd he fell in the oak thicket dead.\nOn the trail ran the eager Winona.\nHalf-famished the raw flesh she ate.\nTo the hungry maid sweet was her supper\nThen swift through the night ran her feet,\nand she trailed the sleek roebuck behind her;\nAnd the guide of her steps was a star \nthe cold-glinting star of Waz'ya[BO] \nOver meadow and hilltop afar, on the way\nto the lodge of her father.\nBut hark! on the keen frosty air\nwind the shrill hunger-howls of the gray-wolves!\nAnd nearer, still nearer! the blood\nof the deer have they scented and follow;\nThrough the thicket, the meadow, the wood,\ndash the pack on the trail of Winona.\nSwift she speeds with her burden,\nbut swift on her track fly the minions of famine;\nNow they yell on the view from the drift,\nin the reeds at the marge of the meadow;\nRed gleam their wild, ravenous eyes,\nfor they see on the hill-side their supper;\nThe dark forest echoes their cries,\nbut her heart is the heart of a warrior.\nFrom its sheath snatched Winona her knife,\nand a leg from the roebuck she severed;\nWith the carcass she ran for her life, \nto a low-branching oak ran the maiden;\nRound the deer's neck her head-strap[BP] was tied;\nswiftly she sprang to the arms of the oak-tree;\nQuick her burden she drew to her side,\nand higher she clomb on the branches,\nWhile the maddened wolves battled and bled,\ndealing death o'er the leg to each other;\nTheir keen fangs devouring the dead, \nyea, devouring the flesh of the living,\nThey raved and they gnashed and they growled,\nlike the fiends in the regions infernal;\nThe wide night re-echoing howled,\nand the hoarse North-wind laughed o'er the slaughter.\nBut their ravenous maws unappeased\nby the blood and the flesh of their fellows,\nTo the cold wind their muzzles they raised,\nand the trail to the oak-tree they followed.\nRound and round it they howled for the prey,\nmadly leaping and snarling and snapping;\nBut the brave maiden's keen arrows slay,\ntill the dead number more than the living.\nAll the long, dreary night-time, at bay,\nin the oak sat the shivering Winona;\nBut the sun gleamed at last, and away\nskulked the gray cowards[BQ] down through the forest.\nThen down dropped the deer and the maid.\nEre the sun reached the midst of his journey,\nHer red, welcome burden she laid\nat the feet of her famishing father.\nWaz'ya's wild wrath was appeased,\nand homeward he turned to his teepee,[3]\nO'er the plains and the forest-land breezed\nfrom the Islands of Summer the South-wind.\nFrom their dens came the coon and the bear;\no'er the snow through the woodlands they wandered;\nOn her snow-shoes with stout bow and spear\non their trails ran the huntress Winona.\nThe coon to his den in the tree,\nand the bear to his burrow she followed;\nA brave, skillful hunter was she,\nand Ta-t'-psin's lodge laughed with abundance.\n"
